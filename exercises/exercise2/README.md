# Exercise 2 - RPA Challenge Automations

In this exercise, we will create the automations that will allow you to run the RPA challenge either successfully or with error to allow you experiment the Cold debugging feature.

## Exercise 2.1 First Automation

After completing these steps you will have created your first automation.

## Exercise 2.2 Test Download Challenge

After completing these steps you will have tested the first part of your automation, making a download of the excel file.

This excel file is needed for the second part of the automation where you will use it with Excel Cloud Link activity.

## Exercise 2.3 Fill Fields Automation

After completing these steps you will have created a second automation that will be used in a loop as a sub-automation.

## Exercise 2.4 Run RPA Challenge with error and Project Pane

After completing these steps you will have created 
- a Run RPA Challenge automation that will have an error during runtime.
- a Project Pane that will hold two attended automations
    - Run RPA Challenge
    - Run RPA Challenge with error

## Summary

You've now completed the exercise 2 with aProject Pane and all the automations needed to run the RPA Challenge in different situations: with and without error.
