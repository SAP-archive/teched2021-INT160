# Exercise 2 - RPA Challenge Automations

In this exercise, you will create the automations that will allow you to run the RPA challenge either successfully or with error.

## Exercise 2.1 First Automation

After completing this exercise you will have created your first automation.

- Once the application is declared and the elements you want to work with have been recognized and declared, you can create your automation.
Automations are executed on the Desktop Agent of your local machine.  They are composed of a succession of steps you build in the Cloud Studio with the automation designer. An automation can orchestrate multiple activities on different applications and screens available on a specific computer.
- In this exercise, you will work on the first part of your automation. The bot you will create will open the [RPA Challenge website](http://www.rpachallenge.com), click on the Download Excel button and if the path entered in the bot (where the excel file should be downloaded) exists, will download it and store it on your computer.

## Exercise 2.2 Test Download Challenge

After completing these steps you will have tested the first part of your automation, making a download of the excel file.

This excel file is needed for the second part of the automation where you will use it with Excel Cloud Link activity.

## Exercise 2.3 Fill Fields Automation

After completing these steps you will have created a second automation that will be used in a loop as a sub-automation.

## Exercise 2.4 Run RPA Challenge with error and Project Pane

After completing these steps you will have created:
- a Run RPA Challenge automation that will have an error during runtime.
- a Project Pane that will hold two attended automations
    - Run RPA Challenge
    - Run RPA Challenge with error

## Summary

You've now completed the exercise 2 with a Project Pane and all the automations needed to run the RPA Challenge in different situations: with and without error.
With the first case with error, in the next exercise, you will experience the power of the Cold debugging to understand the raised error.
