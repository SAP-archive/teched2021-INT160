# Exercise 3 - deployment & Cold debugging

In this [exercise](3%20-%20Deployment%20&%20Cold%20debugging.pdf), you will deploy your project and test it with error and follow the steps of the cold debugging.

- Once you have finished designing your project, you can generate a package from it. You will then create an environment for your project. An environment represents the functional landscape in which your automation is deployed and executed. After you have added the RPA Challenge package to your environment, and hence combining this package with an environment, you can add an agent.
- In fact, before an environment can be used, it must contain at least one agent. Adding agents to an environment links agents to an environment so that packages/jobs can be distributed to them. An agent is a local component consisting of a computer system (PC, desktop or server) and a user session that executes an automation scenario.
- Then, you will add an attended trigger. By doing so, the deployed package is distributed to a specific group of agents and the automation can be run manually by the user.
- Finally, you will activate Traces. In the SAP Intelligent RPA Factory, you can record and retrieve the traces sent by the Desktop Agent on failed jobs. The traces enable monitoring and can help identify potential issues.

After completing this exercise you will have completed the whole workshop with its 3 exercises. 

## Summary

You've now completed exercise 3 with a Project deployed and tested with Cold debugging features. Congratulations!!
